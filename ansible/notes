- create 2 ec2 instances and enable ssh via pubic private key.
- install ansible in instance_1 as,
  - sudo apt update
  - sudo apt install ansible
  - ansible --version

- create pub/private key pair on ec2 instance_1 using `ssh-keygen` and do the same on ec2 instance_2 as well.
- copy the public key from ec2 instance_1 and paste it in `authorized_keys` in ec2 instance_2 to 
  enable ssh instance_2 from instance_1.
- create an `inventory` file in instance_1 and place the private IP address of instance_2 in this file
  and run the following command from instance_1,
  - ansible -i inventory all -m "shell" -a "touch devopsclass"  (this command is used to run adhoc commands)

- Now verify the same file `devopsclass` on instance_2 and if successful, ansible is working!

- To run the playbook, use the following command,
  - ansible-playbook -i inventory my_playbook.yaml
  - ansible-playbook -vvv -i inventory my_playbook.yaml   (run the playbook with highest verbosity level)
