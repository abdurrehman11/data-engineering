Data Modeling has 3 layers

Data modeling is an essential part of data engineering, and it consists of three layers: conceptual, logical, and physical. 

1- Conceptual Data Modeling
Represent the organization structure at a very high level, showing the key entities and relationships but not delving into details.

2- Logical Data Modeling
It is a bridge between Conceptual and Physical data Modeling. Includes entity names, relationships and attributes but not specific tecnical details like data types.

3- Physical Data Modeling
Includes detailed information such as table names, column names, data types and constraints. Specifies Primary and Foreign keys, indexes,
triggers and other database specific features. Optimized for performance and storage efficiency.

Normalization -> a process that organizes data attributes efficiently and aiming to reduce the duplication of data and increase the data integrity.
