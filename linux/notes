2- Shell script to list all processes
  - ps -ef

3- Script to Print only errors from a remote log (e.g. google storage/ aws s3 bucket)
  - curl <google-storage-url / s3-bucket-url> | grep ERROR

4- Shell script to print numbers divisible by 3 and 5 but not 15
  - print_numbers.sh

5- Script to print number of "S" in mississippi
  - print_char.sh

6- how will you debug the shell script
  - set -x

7- what is crontab in linux? Can you provide an example of usage?
  - Schedule the execution of a job. For exmaple, schedule a shell script to execute at 6pm daily 
    and generate report and send on email.

8- How to open a file in read-only mode?
  - vim -r file.txt

9- What is difference between soft and hard link?
  - A soft link is a pointer to another file or directory by its path name.
  - It is a separate file that contains the path of the target file or directory.
  - If the target file or directory is deleted or moved, the soft link becomes broken (dangling) and points to nothing.
  - For example, I have a `myfile` in path `/home/user/folder1/folder2/folder3/myfile` and now
    inside another folder `/tmp`, I create a soft link to this file as,
      - ln -s /home/user/folder1/folder2/folder3/myfile soft_myfile  
    and now if I do `cat soft_myfile` from `/tmp` folder, I will be able to see the content of `myfile`
  - Also, if you do any changes in `soft_myfile`, it will be reflected in original/target file `myfile` as well.

  - A hard link is very similar to soft link but in hard link, a shared copy will be created which means any changes in 
    the content of either hard link file or target file will be reflected in both files. 
  - Also, if you remove target/original file, hard link file will not be removed and you can still access it.

10- What is difference between break and continue statements?
  - break a loop on certain condition
  - skip some part of the loop and continue the loop on certain condition

11- Is bash dynamic or statically typed language?
  - Bash is dynamically typed language similar to python because we don't explicitly specify 
    the data types and it infers dynamically at run time.

12- Network troubleshooting utility?
  - traceroute <url-name/ip-address>
  - traceroute google.com

13- How will you manage logs of a system that generate hugs log files everyday?
  - Managing logs for a system that generates large log files every day in Linux involves several steps to ensure 
    efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of logs
  - Use the logrotate utility, which is a standard tool for managing log files in Linux. logrotate can 
    automatically rotate, compress, and archive log files based on criteria such as size, age, or specific schedules.
