Solution: Very important point to understand is that when we only use PARTITION BY, it considers the full partition for every row,
however if we use ORDER BY then for each row, it considers the n preceding and current row as window 
which results in cumulative aggregations. 

WITH TitleAverages AS (
  SELECT
    employee_id,
    salary,
    title,
    AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY title) AS average_salary
  FROM employees
)

SELECT
  employee_id,
  salary,
  CASE
    WHEN salary > 2 * average_salary THEN 'Overpaid'
    WHEN salary < 0.5 * average_salary THEN 'Underpaid'
    ELSE 'Neither Overpaid nor Underpaid'
  END AS compensation_status
FROM TitleAverages;





Q # https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twogJMRbhLw&ab_channel=DataEngineeringStudies

Write a query to find the user ids of everyone who filed their taxes with any version of Turboxtax three or more years in 
a row. Display the output in ascending order of user_ids.

Assumption:
- As reflected in the table, a user can only file taxes once a year using one product.

Table: filed_taxes

Column Name | Type 
filing_id | integer
user_id | integer
filing_date | datetime 
product | varchar

Solution:

WITH
tax_year AS (
    SELECT *, EXTRACT(YEAR FRM filing_date) AS filing_year 
    FROM filed_taxes
    WHERE LOWER(product) LIKE "turboxtax%"
),

tax AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        LAG(filing_year) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY filing_year) AS prev_year,
        filing_year AS current_year,
        LEAD(filing_year) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY filing_year) AS next_year
    FROM tax_year
)

SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM tax
WHERE next_year - prev_year = 2
ORDER BY user_id
;
